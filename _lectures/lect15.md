# Topics

* Why does recursion feel like magic?
* Step through the evolution of the program stack with nested function calls
* Recursive thinking and design of recursive functions
* The two key properties of a correct recursive function
  * Stopping condition (also known as base case) - there may be multiple of these
  * Progress towards the base case in the recursive step
* Pitfalls in code that violate the two key properties
* Under the hood of execution of recursive functions by visualizing the program stack
