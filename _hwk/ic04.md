Disregard the instruction above about "homework buddies" for this in-class assignment.  For this assignment:

* Asking for help from the professor is allowed and encouraged

Those conditions will NOT be true on the final exam.  This is just for practice.

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:14em"> (20 pts) Write the definition of a Python function `maskedPassword` that takes one parameter `pw` and returns a string consisting of the first three characters contained in the variable `pw` followed by 'x's instead of the remaining characters in `pw`.  The length of the returned value should be the same as the length of the parameter passed in. (YOU MAY ASSUME `pw` is of type `str`)

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:20em"> (24 pts) Write the definition of a Python function `minOfTwoLists` that takes two lists as parameters: `alist` and `blist`. The functions returns a new list where each element in the new list is the minimum of the
corresponding elements in `alist` and `blist`. The function should return `False` if either `alist` or `blist` is not a list or if either of them contains anything
other than numbers (either int or float)
