<b>READING ASSIGNMENT</b>

Please read {{page.desc}}.  Then complete these problems and turn in your completed homework during lecture

<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:0em;"> The second half of Section 7.1 discusses Stack Frames.   Two things that can happen with a stack frame are a "push" event and "pop" event.

<ol>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2em;"> (5 pts) What event in a running Python program is associated with the "push" of a stack frame onto the stack?
</li>
<li markdown="1" style="margin-bottom:2em;"> (5 pts) What event in a running Python program is associated with the "pop" of a stack frame from the stack?

</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li markdown="1"> Section 7.1 discusses three of the most important benefits of using functions:

* <em>reuse</em>
* <em>modularity</em>, also called <em>procedural decomposition</em>
* <em>encapsulation</em> also called <em>information hiding</em>

Below are some things that a programmer might say about one of the functions
in the example code in the book. Indicate by circling, which benefit of
functions is illustrated by the quote.  Then, justify your answer with a brief explanation.

That explanation should pertain *specifically* to the code shown, and *NOT* simply be a restateement
of the definitions of the terms from the textbook, or "copy/paste" verbatim quote from the textbook.

(Note it is possible there may be more than one reasonable choice among the three benefits.   Choose one and support it,
or circle more than one, and explain why you feel more than one applies.)

In a blackjack program, instead of writing this code to deal one card to the player, and one card to the house:

```
card = deck.pop()
player.append(card)
card = deck.pop()
house.append(card)
```

We can write this code:

```
dealCard(deck, player)    # deal to player first
dealCard(deck, house)     # deal to house second
```

Using the function:

```
def dealCard(deck, participant):
    'deals single card from deck to participant'
    card = deck.pop()
    participant.append(card)
    return card
```
