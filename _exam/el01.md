The main topics you will be tested on are lists, strings, while loops and for loops
You will be given two problems that are very similar to the problems you have seen on labs 05 and lab06. However, no test code will be provided.

You must write your own test code and solution, and when you are satisfied submit your solution on submit.cs. You can only see a partial score after submission.

You must be comfortable with topics covered in the following components:
* Labs 1 to 6
* Homeworks 1 to 11 (excluding hw 6, 7 and 10 (Chapter 4))
All topics in chapters 2,3, 5 with high emphasis on chapter 5 (loops)

* Read the question carefully!
* Test your code thoroughly!
